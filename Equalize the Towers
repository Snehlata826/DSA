Equalize the Towers
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 52.18%Submissions: 24K+Points: 4
You are given an array heights[] representing the heights of towers and another array cost[] where each element represents the cost of modifying the height of respective tower.

The goal is to make all towers of same height by either adding or removing blocks from each tower.
Modifying the height of tower 'i' by 1 unit (add or remove) costs cost[i].
Return the minimum cost to equalize the heights of all the towers.

Code:
class Solution:
    def minCost(self,heights,cost):
        towers = list(zip(heights,cost))
        towers.sort()

        total_cost = sum(cost)
        curr = 0

        for h,c in towers:
            curr+=c
            if curr>= total_cost/2:
                target=h
                break
        ans=0
        for h,c in towers:
            ans+= abs(h-target)*c
        return ans
